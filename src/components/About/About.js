                Hi! As you know from the message above, I'm Evan Krainess, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Minnesota with a strong passion for building scalable software and solving complex problems.

            <p>
                I'm an incoming Software Engineer at Capital One. Previously, I interned at Daikin Applied and also have worked under an NSF REU grant, where I was the second author on a published paper that advanced anomaly detection methods using Hyperdimensional Computing.

                My main passion in life is to learn. Whether it’s building software, exploring a new technology stack, or diving into a complex research problem, I’m driven by curiosity and the desire to understand how things work. I love tackling challenges that require both creativity and technical depth, and I find a lot of joy in writing clean, thoughtful code that solves real problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of school and work, I have many hobbies. I enjoy staying active—whether I'm weightlifting, running, hiking, or playing sports like basketball and pickleball. I'm also a fan of various forms of media. I love reading—my favorite series is probably The Stormlight Archive. When it comes to video games, my go-to genres are usually RPGs or Souls-likes.
            </p>
